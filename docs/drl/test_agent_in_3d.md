# DRL Agent Deployment in Arena-Rosnav-3D

The following steps presume that you have already successfully installed [Arena-Rosnav-3D](https://github.com/ignc-research/arena-rosnav-3D).

1. Check if the robot model is supported
2. Move the folder containing the trained model's files to:
   https://github.com/ignc-research/arena-rosnav-3D/tree/main/arena_navigation/arena_local_planer/learning_based/arena_local_planner_drl/agents/rosnav
3. Start the simulation as is instructed in the repo's [Usage.md](https://github.com/ignc-research/arena-rosnav-3D/blob/main/docs/Usage.md#example)(if you are using rosnav for the first time, you should first take a look at this [section](https://github.com/ignc-research/arena-rosnav-3D/blob/main/docs/Usage.md#local-planner-rosnav-navrep-guldenring))
